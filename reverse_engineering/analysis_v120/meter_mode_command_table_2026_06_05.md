# Meter Mode Raw Command Table, 2026-06-05

This note records the local extraction of the eight-byte stock meter-mode raw
command table referenced by the `0x080BB3FC` notes.

The archived V1.2.0 app binary is loaded at app-slot VMA `0x08004000`, while the
current decompile notes use addresses as if the app started at `0x08000000`.
For literal data, `raw_app_base_offset_2026_04_08.md` says to inspect
`runtime_literal - 0x4000` in the current project/raw image. Applying that to
`0x080BB3FC` gives raw address `0x080B43FC`, file offset `0x000B43FC`.

Extraction from `archive/2C53T Firmware V1.2.0/APP_2C53T_V1.2.0_251015.bin`:

```text
14 0c 17 0b 0a 12 11 10
```

These bytes are the low byte of raw UART words of the form `0x0500 | table[i]`.
They are not display/update selector bytes from queue `0x20002D6C`.

Local port:

| Stock meter mode | Low byte | Raw word |
|---:|---:|---:|
| 0 | `0x14` | `0x0514` |
| 1 | `0x0C` | `0x050C` |
| 2 | `0x17` | `0x0517` |
| 3 | `0x0B` | `0x050B` |
| 4 | `0x0A` | `0x050A` |
| 5 | `0x12` | `0x0512` |
| 6 | `0x11` | `0x0511` |
| 7 | `0x10` | `0x0510` |

## Local Porting Map

The open firmware exposes eleven UI submodes, while the stock table has eight
stock slots. The current port therefore maps local UI state onto the recovered
stock slots below. This is a porting map, not proof that stock has eleven
separate modes.

| Local UI submode | Meaning | Stock slot | Selector | Extra apply word | Parser frame family |
|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | DC voltage | 0 | `0x0514` | none | voltage |
| 1 | AC voltage | 1 | `0x050C` | `0x050D` | voltage |
| 2 | DC current, small range | 2 | `0x0517` | `0x050E` | current |
| 3 | DC current, A range | 2 | `0x0517` | `0x050E` | current |
| 4 | AC current, small range | 3 | `0x050B` | none | current |
| 5 | AC current, A range | 3 | `0x050B` | none | current |
| 6 | resistance | 4 | `0x050A` | none | resistance |
| 7 | continuity | 6 | `0x0511` | `0x0516` | continuity |
| 8 | diode | 7 | `0x0510` | `0x0515` | diode |
| 9 | capacitance | 5 | `0x0512` | none | extended |
| 10 | temperature | 5 | `0x0512` | none | extended |

## Current Range Evidence Boundary

Stock selector slots 2 and 3 are the only current slots recovered from the
eight-byte command table:

| Stock slot | Selector | Stock formatter evidence | Local use |
|---:|---:|---|---|
| 2 | `0x0517` | `full_decompile.c` case 2 writes display unit state `4` for one DCA range and `3` for another, keyed by `DAT_2000102e`. `meter_fsm_deep_dive.md` maps those unit indices to inferred mA and A unit strings. | local DC current small range and DC A range |
| 3 | `0x050B` | `full_decompile.c` case 3 writes display unit state `5`; `meter_fsm_deep_dive.md` maps that unit index to an inferred ACA mA unit string. | local AC current small range; AC A is only local policy until proven |

No inspected stock path proves a separate uA selector, and no inspected AC path
proves an A-range ACA formatter. The stock evidence so far distinguishes DC
current ranges through frame/display unit state, not through additional
command-table slots. Until the runtime writer for the stock range state is
recovered or bench-proven, local uA and AC A labels are parser/UI policy on top
of the two recovered current slots.

## Extended Slot 5 Evidence Boundary

Stock slot 5 is solidly recovered as selector `0x0512`. The meaning of the
local capacitance and temperature split is narrower:

- `fpga_task_annotated.c` records the stock result-formatting switch case 5 as
  `digit_count + 2` for capacitance-like formatting.
- `meter_math_pipeline_annotated.c` contains a mode-5 conversion path using
  `value = value * 9 / 5 + 32` when the flag at `+0xF39` is set, with a
  Fahrenheit `32.0f` literal nearby.
- The local port maps both capacitance and temperature to stock slot 5 and
  parses both as the extended frame family.

That is evidence for a shared extended slot, not proof that stock exposes
separate capacitance and temperature selector modes matching the open
firmware's eleven UI submodes.

## Transition Timing Evidence Boundary

Stock evidence supports command pacing and frame filtering:

- `fpga_task_annotated.c` shows the TX interrupt enabled, followed by a 10-tick
  delay before accepting the next command.
- `full_decompile.c` and `usart2_isr_state_machine.md` show USART2 framing that
  accepts `0x5A/0xA5` data frames, validates `0xAA/0x55` echo frames, and drops
  invalid echo/data sequences.
- `meter_math_pipeline_annotated.c` marks `{any, 0x13, 0x14, 1..3}` as pending
  auto-range/mode-transition data.

No inspected stock path proves a fixed "discard exactly N frames" or "settle
exactly 20 ms" window after every mode switch. The open firmware's current
two-frame discard plus 20 ms settle is a conservative local transition policy
that should be replaced only when a stock path or repeatable bench capture
proves the exact rule.

## GPIO Mux Evidence Boundary

Stock master init calls the two GPIO mux functions from saved meter state:

```text
0x08025544: ldrb r0, [r4, #2]  ; ms[0x02]
0x08025546: bl   0x080018a4    ; gpio_mux_portc_porte
0x0802554a: ldrb r0, [r4, #3]  ; ms[0x03]
0x0802554c: bl   0x08001a58    ; gpio_mux_porta_portb
```

The same pair repeats after the later probe/attenuation restore block at
`0x0802723e..0x0802724a`. `gpio_mux_portc_porte` controls PC12 and PE4/PE5/PE6;
`gpio_mux_porta_portb` controls PA15, PA10, PB10, and PB11: the decompile at
`0x08001a58..0x08001bba` writes GPIOA bit `0x8000`, GPIOA bit `0x400`, GPIOB bit
`0x400`, and GPIOB bit `0x800` through the BOP/BCR registers. The current
open-firmware transition plan now represents these as separate
`portc_porte_mux` and `porta_portb_mux` fields instead of treating the stock
function/range selectors as one generic mux.

The unresolved part is the live/runtime writer for `ms[0x03]` during local
small-current versus A-range operation. Until that is recovered or bench-proven,
local submodes 2/3 and 4/5 share the same recovered stock current slot and are
split only by parser/UI range state. Treat current readings that still look like
voltage payloads as a frontend activation failure, not a decimal decoder issue.
